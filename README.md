The app actually mimics the content available on the official website of [Anilist](https://anilist.co/) along with same sections available here. The App uses GraphQL API implementation for fetching the data from Anilist servers efficiently and fetching only the data that is needed which avoids overfetching which happens in Rest APIs.
